This is a datapack based off the Life series that I made for a friend who was running a small server for 10-20 players. It's called "Crowned Life", and incorporates the boogeyman mechanic along with a new mechanic known as crowns.

All information on how to operate the datapack can be found in the function life:tick

At the start of the season, three players were to be given "crowns" (selected by the admins), which would appear next to their nametag and mark them as targets for the other players, and rewards would be given out from the admins to players who killed them.
After a crowned player dies, their crown is then given the player with the most lives who has been alive for the longest amount of time, and players who are red will never be given crowns.
The datapack implements this system along with every system that one would expect from a Life series, such as lives, boogeymen, and a few custom crafting recipes.
